# ⚠️ please read this if you don't feel like looking through my [strawpage](https://interestarchive.straw.page), [carrd](https://interestarchive.carrd.co), or [pronouns.cc](https://pronouns.cc/@wolfeier) pages.
## FYI I OFTEN DONT CHAT - **EVEN WITH FRIENDS**. if i have "chat=❌" in my name = not chatting
**_DNI_** if any of these apply: racist, homophobic, transphobic, basically general criteria, darkshippers/proshippers, ableist, zionist...................
          ^^ EDITED BECAUSE APPARENTLY I WAS MISINFORMED ABOUT THE MEANING OF "COMSHIPPER"

i go by a lot of ***names*** - *including the names of characters i like :P* | fabian, wolf/wolfeiier, jesse, astro, mipha, sprout, link, cosmo/cosmos - also, the name of whatever pony i am :P

here are my ***pronouns***. he/him & they/them + neopronouns (yeah i changed my mind abt them, you can find the list on my carrd once it's updated ✌️). i don't like it/its because it *personally* feels dehumanizing (and i consider my humanity to be a very important aspect of my own life). you can also use the pronouns of my pony/cosplay. idrc in that case.

things to know ***before you interact***: i am neurodivergent. i struggle with social cues, sarcasm, and the like. _please_ use **tone tags** if you think it may be necessary. i dont like gross/rude/dark humour. i get overwhelmed when there are a lot of players (yes. i know it's a "pixel horse game"). anyone >18 and <12 can interact. but you cannot ask for my socials outside of ponytown.

some things i **_like_**, incase you wanna interact! - mlp, fnaf, breaking bad (i have just started season 4), trollhunters, dandy's world, superstore, wings of fire, hamilton, art, (the rest r just gonna be youtubers), drew/danny/kurtis, backseat streams, croton, pointcrow, astralspiff, basically any fnaf youtuber ngl, (okay now back to non-youtube), jurassic park, fall out boy (infinity on high)
i also love little emoticons such as :3 / :)) / :P / :c / :D / :T

## DNI, DNIUID, AND IWC - WHAT TO DO/WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
DNI - do not interact | DNIUID - do not interact _unless i do._ = in these cases, please do not try to talk to me, boop/kiss, or sit right beside me. i'm probably upset or overwhelmed. "why don't you just leave the game if you're overwhelmed?" - because i _want_ to keep playing. i just need some time to destress.

IWC - interact with caution = you can talk to me unless i explicitly say otherwise, and you can also boop me and sit near me.
