## ⚠️ please read this if you don't feel like looking through my strawpage, carrd, or pronouns.cc pages.
(I KNOW it looks long. but this is essentially all three of those websites' information compressed.)

i go by a lot of ***names*** - *including the names of characters i like because it makes me **happy***. fabian, wolf/wolfeiier, jesse, astro, mipha - also, the name of whatever pony i am

here are my ***pronouns***. he/him & they/them. i don't like it/its or neopronouns because it *personally* feels dehumanizing. you can also use the pronouns of my skin. idrc in that case.

things to know ***before you interact***: i am neurodivergent. i struggle with social cues, sarcasm, and the like. _please_ use **tone tags** if you think it may be necessary. i dont like gross/rude/dark humour. i get overwhelmed when there are a lot of players (yes. i know it's a "pixel horse game"). anyone >18 and <12 can interact. but you cannot ask for my socials outside of ponytown.

some things i **_like_**, incase you wanna interact! - mlp, fnaf, breaking bad (i have just started season 4), trollhunters, dandy's world, superstore, wings of fire, hamilton, art, (the rest r just gonna be youtubers), drew/danny/kurtis, backseat streams, croton, pointcrow, astralspiff, basically any fnaf youtuber ngl, (okay now back to non-youtube), jurassic park, fall out boy (infinity on high)

**_DNI_** if any of these apply: racist, homophobic, transphobic, basically general criteria, darkshippers/comshippers

## DNI, DNIUID, AND IWC - WHAT TO DO/WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
DNI - do not interact | DNIUID - do not interact _unless i do._ = in these cases, please do not try to talk to me, boop/kiss, or sit right beside me. i'm probably upset or overwhelmed. "why don't you just leave the game if you're overwhelmed?" - because i _want_ to keep playing. i just need some time to destress.

| IWC - interact with caution = you can talk to me unless i explicitly say otherwise, and you can also boop me and sit near me.
